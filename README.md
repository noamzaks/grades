# Grades

An academic grade calculator. Visit [the live website](https://grades-noamzaks.vercel.app).

Use a `grades.json` file to keep you academic grades over courses. The app supports import and export and you can add courses on it. If you need to edit a grade or remove a course, you can edit it using a JSON editor.

Grades displays the following information:

-   Your average.
-   Your total credits.

It displays them over each semester individually as well as overall.

You can choose to ignore a certain course or semester and you will see the average and credits change accordingly.
